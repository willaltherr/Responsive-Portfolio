                <p class="bio">My name is Will Altherr and I currently reside in Richmond, Virginia with my wife Naomi and our dog Wiley.  I moved to Richmond, Virginia about seven years ago from Northern Virginia to work for a local digital marketing agency where I learned a lot about pay-per-click and search engine optimization.  There I learned I wanted to work internally at an ecommerce company in order to enhance my digital marketing skills into something more.  This led me to email marketing, social media marketing, affiliate marketing, display marketing, photoshop, web analytics and even web development.   Out of all these skills, web development is the one I feel most uncomfortable with which is why I signed up for the coding Bootcamp at University of Richmond.  Hopefully, this class will take my skills to the next level and create more opportunities for me as an ecommerce professional.</p>

                <p class="bio">This course is very challenging, but everyone seems to welcome the challenge and the students in the class have been helpful.  The positivity amongst the students makes it a lot easier which Iâ€™m thankful for.  I have a feeling the next six months will go by fast!</p>

                <p class="bio">We have just completed the first week and I have already learned so much which drives me to continue this journey! So far, we have jumped into HTML and CSS which has allowed me to create this portfolio website. Some of the topics we have covered include, margins, padding, positioning, classes, floats and many other topics.</p>
